"Based on our study, we found that when marker genes are expressed at fold change of 4 or more than the rest of the genes, either Seurat or Simlr algorithm can be used to analyze single cell dataset for any number of single cells isolated (minimum 1000 single cells were tested). However, when marker genes are expected to be only up to fC 2 upregulated, choice of the single cell algorithm is dependent on the number of single cells isolated and proportion of rare cell type to be identified.
