Metabolomics
---------------

### Metabobox (2017)

- R package, [paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171046)
- can probably be used with other data types, too
- [github repo](https://github.com/kwanjeeraw/mETABOX) 
- features:
	- Data normalization and data transformation
	- Univariate statistical analyses with hypothesis testing procedures that are automatically selected based on study designs
	- Joint and interactive visualization of genes, proteins and metabolites in different combinations of networks
   - Calculation of data-driven networks using correlation-based approaches
   - Calculation of chemical structure similarity networks from substructure fingerprints
   - Functional interpretation with overrepresentation analysis, functional class scoring and WordCloud generation

#### Network analysis

* internal graph database: a _pre-compiled graph database_, which is used for collecting prior knowledge from several [resources](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171046.s001&type=supplementary) (Note: based on GRCh38 (!))
