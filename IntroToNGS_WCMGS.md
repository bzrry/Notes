Typical problems of Illumina-based sequencing data are:

* PCR artifacts such as duplicated fragments, lack of fragments with very high or very low GC content and biases towards shorter read lengths
* sequencing errors and mis-identified bases

These problems can be mitigated, but not completely eliminated, with careful library preparation and frequent updates of Illumina's machines and chemistry.
