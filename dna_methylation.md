## DNA methylation basics

see [Messerschmidt Review (2014)]

* undetectable in certain yeast, nematode, and fly species
* in mamamals, DNA methylation is vital
    * mostly in __symmetrical CpG context__
    * single CpGs typically hypermethylated vs. unmethylated CpG islands --> __low CpG density promoters__ are generally hypermethylated, yet active vs. __high CpG density promoters__ that are inactive if methylated
    * __transposons__ are repressed if methylated (esp. LINEs, LTRs), so are __pericentromeric repeats__
    * __imprinted genes__ show parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation (introduced during gamete differentiation) and subsequently allele-specific gene expression

### DNA methylation machinery

#### _de novo_ methylation

--> __Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b__

* maternally provided (Dnmt3a)

#### methylation maintenance

--> __Dnmt1__

* high affinity for hemimethylation
* its deletion in mESCs causes hypotmethylation, but not a complete loss (lethal effect, though)

_Dnmt2_ is a misnomer: it methylates RNA, not DNA
