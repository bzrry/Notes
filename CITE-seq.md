# CITE-seq

Cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) is a 
technique that quantifies both gene expression and the abundance of selected 
surface proteins in each cell simultaneously (Stoeckius et al. 2017). 

In this approach, cells are first labelled with **antibodies that have been 
conjugated to synthetic RNA tags**.
A cell with a higher abundance of a target protein will be bound by more antibodies, 
causing more molecules of the corresponding antibody-derived tag (ADT) to be attached to that cell. [Ref.OSCA](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/integrating-with-protein-abundance.html)

# How should the ADT data be incorporated into the analysis?

While we have counts for both ADTs and transcripts, there are fundamental differences
in nature of the data that make it difficult to treat the former as additional features
in the latter:

* small number of antibodies vs. entire transcriptome
* coverage of the ADTs is much deeper (sequencing resources are concentrated into a smaller number of features)
* use of antibodies against protein targets involves consideration of separate biases compared to those observed for transcripts.

# Reading in the data

from [OSCA](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/integrating-with-protein-abundance.html)


```
# CellRanger data here:
/athena/abc/scratch/paz2005/projects/2020_11_sofia_scrna/cellranger_v5_out
```

```
conda create --name citeseq
conda install -c conda-forge r-base 
conda install -c conda-forge r-data.table 
conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-scuttle
conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-singlecellexperiment 
conda install -c r r-ggplot2 
```

* `SingleCellExperiment` class --> "alternative Experiment"
    - to store data for different sets of features but the same cells
    - can be used to store another SE object inside the SCE object
    - often used for spike-in data
    - isolates the two sets of features to ensure that analyses on one set o not use data from the other set
    
```{r}
sce <- splitAltExps(sce, rowData(sce)$Type)
altExpNames(sce) # Can be used like any other SingleCellExperiment. 

# ADT counts are usually not sparse so storage as a sparse matrix provides no advantage
counts(altExp(sce)) <- as.matrix(counts(altExp(sce)))
counts(altExp(sce))[,1:10] # sneak peek
```

## QC 

### Genes: low mito content!

```{r}
mito <- grep("^MT-", rowData(sce)$Symbol)
df <- perCellQCMetrics(sce, subsets=list(Mito=mito))
mito.discard <- isOutlier(df$subsets_Mito_percent, type="higher")
```


### ADTs

* remove cells that have failed to capture and/or sequence the ADTs
* background contamination: free antibody or antibody bound to cell fragments

ALL ADTs SHOULD HAVE READS! [otherwise something went wront with the processing!]

```{r}
# remove cells that have unusually low numbers of detected ADTs
# Applied on the alternative experiment containing the ADT counts:
library(scuttle)
df.ab <- perCellQCMetrics(altExp(sce))

n.nonzero <- sum(!rowAlls(counts(altExp(sce)), value=0L)) # less than or equal to half of the total number of tags
ab.discard <- df.ab$detected <= n.nonzero/2 # 
summary(ab.discard)
```

### Final filtering step

```{r}
discard <- ab.discard | mito.discard
sce <- sce[,!discard]
```

# Normalizing ADTs

>simplest approach is to normalize on the total ADT counts
>However, ideally, we would like to compute size factors that adjust for the composition biases. This usually requires an assumption that most ADTs are not differentially expressed between cell types/states.

>We consider the baseline ADT profile to be a combination of weak constitutive expression and ambient contamination, both of which should be constant across the population. We estimate this profile by assuming that the distribution of abundances for each ADT should be bimodal, where one population of cells exhibits low baseline expression and another population upregulates the corresponding protein target. We then use all cells in the lower mode to compute the baseline abundance for that ADT. This entire calculation is performed by the inferAmbience() function
> We use a DESeq2-like approach to compute size factors against the baseline profile. Specifically, the size factor for each cell is defined as the median of the ratios of that cellâ€™s counts to the baseline profile. If the abundances for most ADTs in each cell are baseline-derived, they should be roughly constant across cells; any systematic differences in the ratios correspond to cell-specific biases in sequencing coverage and are captured by the size factor. The use of the median protects against the minority of ADTs corresponding to genuinely expressed targets.

```{r}
baseline <- inferAmbience(counts(altExp(sce)))
# Distribution of (log-)counts for each ADT in the PBMC dataset, with the inferred ambient abundance marked by the black dot. 
plotExpression(altExp(sce), features=rownames(altExp(sce)), exprs_values="counts") +
    scale_y_log10() + 
    geom_point(data=data.frame(x=names(baseline), y=baseline), mapping=aes(x=x, y=y), cex=3)

sf.amb <- medianSizeFactors(altExp(sce), reference=baseline)
# add median-based size factors to the altExp
sizeFactors(altExp(sce)) <- sf.amb

# logNorm will transform both expression and ADT
sce <- logNormCounts(sce, use.altexps=TRUE)
```


# Clustering

>Unlike transcript-based counts, feature selection is largely unnecessary for analyzing ADT data. This is because feature selection has already occurred during experimental design where the manual choice of target proteins means that all ADTs correspond to interesting features by definition
> ADT abundances are cleaner (larger counts, stronger signal) for more robust identification of broad cell types

```{r}
# Set d=NA so that the function does not perform PCA.
g.adt <- buildSNNGraph(altExp(sce), d=NA) 
clusters.adt <- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g.adt)$membership

# Generating a t-SNE plot.
library(scater)
set.seed(1010010)
altExp(sce) <- runTSNE(altExp(sce))
colLabels(altExp(sce)) <- factor(clusters.adt)
plotTSNE(altExp(sce), colour_by="label", text_by="label", text_col="red")
```

# Integration with gene expression data

> If the aim is to test for differences in the functional readout (e.g. using antibodies to target the influenza peptide-MHCII complexes), a natural analysis strategy is to *use the transcript data for clustering* (Figure 20.13) and perform differential testing between clusters or conditions for the relevant ADTs. The main appeal of this approach is that it avoids data snooping (Section 11.5.1) as the clusters are defined without knowledge of the ADTs. This improves the statistical rigor of the subsequent differential testing on the ADT abundances
