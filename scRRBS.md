scRRBS
============

* original paper: [Guo et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24179143)

* general pros/cons of RRBS apply:
	* low coverage of regions with little CpG density
	* generally sparse representation: ca. 1 mio CpGsv(1-10% of all CpGs)
	* improved detection of promoter/CpG-rich regions
	* relatively consistent across replicates

	
[DeepCpG](https://github.com/PMBio/deepcpg/blob/master/examples/README.md) can be used to impute missing values to get a more granular picture at the single-cell level
